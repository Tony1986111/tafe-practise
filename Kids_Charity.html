        <h2>Your generous support will help children in need</h2>
    The Smith Family’s Toy & Book Appeal is your opportunity to help bring a smile to a 
    disadvantaged child’s face this Christmas. Sadly, thousands of Australian children 
    will go without receiving a gift this holiday season simply because their families 
    can’t afford it. Your generous support will help children in need to acquire the skills 
    and knowledge they need to build a better future and help them to create a sense of 
    belonging this Christmas. During this pandemic, the children and families we support 
    remain at the heart of everything we do, and more than ever before, it’s so important 
    that we help them end 2020 on a brighter note. With your help, we are aiming to support 
    32,550 Australian families with children living in disadvantage for the 2020 Toy & Book Appeal.  
    There are a variety of ways to get involved in the lead up to Christmas this year. Keep reading

        <h2>Reduce children’s anxiety during Covid-19</h2>
    As we experience an unprecedented global pandemic and the spread of the coronavirus 
    continues to gain momentum globally, children are being exposed to frequent media updates, panicked behaviour, 
    and anxious conversations.This can be a challenging experience for children and can potentially affect their 
    mental health for weeks, months and years to come. It’s only natural that they will have a lot of questions about 
    the pandemic, so it’s important that as adults we reassure them, remain calm and provide age appropriate answers to 
    questions to help reduce children’s anxiety. <br>
